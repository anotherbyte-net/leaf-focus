Limitations in This Release

The following features are not currently supported or have limited support in this driver release:

Image Sharpening Feature

NVIDI A Control Panel Image sharpening controls, including GPU upscaling, are introduced in the
R440 driver. Currently, the following limitations apply.
 Scaling is not supported on MSHybrid systems.
 HDR displays driven by pre-Turing GPUs will not support scaling
 Scaling will not work with VR
 Scaling will not work with displays using YUV420 format.
 Scaling uses aspect ratio scaling and will not use integer scaling
 Sharpening will not work with HDR displays
 GPU scaling engages when games are played only in full-screen mode, and not in windowed

    or borderless windowed mode.
 Some G-SYNC displays have a 6-tap/64-phase scaler which scales better than that offered by

    Turing's 5-tap/32-phase scaler.
 To avoid accidentally triggering scaling by applications or DWM, first change to the desired (<

    native) resolution from the NVIDIA Control Panel and then launch the application.
 Turing's 5-tap upscaler may not engage on certain monitors depending on the monitor's

    vblank timing.
 Turing's 5-tap upscaler may not engage if the input resolution is greater than 2560px in either

    the x or y dimension.
 Scaling is turned off automatically when switching display devices.
 "Restore Defaults" option in the control panel currently does not revert the upscaling

    resolution.

Behavior Change in NvEncCreateBitstreamBuffer API of Video
Codec SDK

In the NVIDIA driver, Release 415 and later, the behavior of the Video Codec SDK API
(NvEncCreateBitstreamBuffer) has been changed to return NV_ENC_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED instead
of NV_ENC_SUCCESS when the encoder instance is configured to run in the motion estimation-only
mode. As an indirect consequence of this change, the AppEncME sample application from the
Video Codec SDK prior to SDK version 8.2.16 will crash due to a bug in the NvEncoder class.

The latest version of the SDK fixes this bug that affects the AppEncME sample application. NVIDIA
recommends downloading the latest version from https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-
codec-sdk.

Connecting Displays to NVIDIA Turing GPUs in SLI Mode

To use SLI with NVIDIA Turing GPUs, all displays must be connected to the master GPU.

Turing GPU Driver Installation on Windows 10

Drivers for Turing GPUs will not be installed on systems with Windows 10 RS2 or earlier. This
includes Windows 10 Threshold 1, Threshold 2, Redstone 1, and Redstone 2 operating systems.

Crescent Bay and OSVR Headsets on Multiple GPU Systems

With Release 367 and future NVIDIA drivers, Crescent Bay and Open Source Virtual Reality
development kit headsets will not work with VRWorks Direct Mode in systems that contain GPUs
from multiple vendors (for example, NVIDIA and Intel). For such systems, please disable the Intel
integrated graphics (from the system BIOS) in order to use Direct Mode.

Experimental OpenCL 2.0 Features

Select features in OpenCL 2.0 are available in the driver for evaluation purposes only. The
following are the features as well as a description of known issues with these features in the
driver:
 Device side enqueue

    ·The current implementation is limited to 64-bit platforms only.
    ·OpenCL 2.0 allows kernels to be enqueued with global_work_size larger than the compute

        capability of the NVIDIA GPU. The current implementation supports only combinations of
        global_work_size and local_work_size that are within the compute capability of the NVIDIA
        GPU.
        The maximum supported CUDA grid and block size of NVIDIA GPUs is available at http://
        docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities. For
        a given grid dimension, the global_work_size can be determined by CUDA grid size x CUDA
        block size.

    ·For executing kernels (whether from the host or the device), OpenCL 2.0 supports non-

        uniform ND-ranges where global_work_size does not need to be divisible by the
        local_work_size. This capability is not yet supported in the NVIDIA driver, and therefore not
        supported for device side kernel enqueues.
 Shared virtual memory

    ·The current implementation of shared virtual memory is limited to 64-bit platforms only.

Issues Not Caused by NVIDIA Drivers

This section lists issues that are not due to the NVIDIA driver as well as features that are not
meant to be supported by the NVIDIA driver.
 "Windows 10 Considerations" on page 12
 "Windows 7 Considerations" on page 12
 "Operating System Issues" on page 13
 "Application Issues" on page 13

Windows 10 Considerations

Cross-adapter Clone Mode

Under Windows 10, clone mode across graphics processors is handled by the Windows OS, and
not by the NVIDIA driver. Consequently, there are no controls for cross-adapter clone mode in the
NVIDIA Control Panel under Windows 10.

Functionality of some display controls in the NVIDIA Control Panel may be affected if cross-
adapter clone mode is enabled through the Windows Control Panel. In this case, use the Windows
Control Panel to adjust display settings.

Optimus Systems

Because cross-adapter clone mode is handled by the Windows 10 OS, there are no display
controls in the NVIDIA Control Panel if no display is connected to the NVIDIA GPU on Optimus
notebooks.

Windows 7 Considerations

Hotplug Action

Under Windows 7, the default settings are not applied when a new display is hotplugged, and
there is no message balloon alert stating that a new display was detected. All display connection
and detection events are handled through the Windows 7 Connecting and Configuring Displays
(CCD) mechanism.

Driver Security

Follow these safe computing practices:
 Only download or execute content and programs from trusted third parties.
 Run your system and programs with the least privilege necessary. Users should run without

    administrator rights whenever possible.
 When running as administrator, do not elevate UAC privileges for activities or programs that

    don't need them.

This section describes additional actions to take to mitigate specific known security issues.

Restricting/Enabling Access to GPU Performance
Counters

The NVIDIA graphics driver contains a vulnerability (CVE-2018-6260) that may allow access to
application data processed on the GPU through a side channel exposed by the GPU performance
counters. GPU performance counters are needed by developers in order to use NVIDIA developer
tools such as CUPTI, Nsight Graphics, and Nsight Compute. In order to address CVE-2018-6260
the driver (starting with version 419.67) automatically disables access for non-admin users.
For more information about CVE-2018-6260 visit the NVIDIA Security Bulletin 4772.
Access to GPU performance counters can be enabled for non-admin users who need to use
NVIDIA developer tools. Enabling access to GPU performance counters can be accomplished
through the NVIDIA Control Panel->Developer->Manage GPU Performance Counters page. Refer to
the Developer->Manage GPU Performance Counters section of the NVIDIA Control Panel Help for
instructions.

Updating the NVIDIA VirtualLink PPC Firmware

You can update the NVIDIA VirtualLink PPC firmware from the NVIDIA Control Panel by clicking
Update from the top menu and then selecting Update VirtualLink firmware.

The following is a description of the changes made in the latest version.

Version 3.2.8 (Notebook)

The following are the changes and fixed issues in the NVIDIA VirtualLink PPC firmware version
3.2.8.
 [USBC Notebook] [VirtualLink]: Some USB bus-powered type-C monitors won't light up until

    Windows boots. [2524391]
 [USBC Notebook] [VirtualLink] Some USB Type-C to HDMI dongles may not work. [200474652]
 [USBC Notebook] [VirtualLink] USB-C SuperSpeed does not work with Type-C hub which

    supports multiple (DisplayPort and USB) Alternate Modes. [200482972]

Differing GPU Voltages in SLI Mode

When non-identical GPUs are used in SLI mode, they may run at different voltages. This occurs
because the GPU clocks are kept as close as possible, and the clock of the higher performance
GPU is limited by that of the other. One benefit is that the higher performance GPU saves power by
running at slightly reduced voltages.

An end-user gains nothing by attempting to raise the voltage of the higher performance GPU
because its clocks must not exceed those of the other GPU.

3D Compatibility Mode

3D Compatibility Mode is an NVIDIA proprietary rendering mode for 3D Vision that improves the
3D experience for many key DirectX 10 and 11 games. NVIDIA continues to add game support with
new driver versions.

After resizing the HDTV desktop using the NVIDIA Control Panel Resize controls, the new custom
resolution created is now added to the list of available resolutions for that display, and also added
to the resolution list within the game or application.

The method for resizing the HDTV desktop was improved to provide better image quality when
applying underscan. This method results in a new custom resolution being created which needs
to be selected from games or applications to apply the resizing. In the example displayed in the
following screen shot, the underscan has created a new resolution (1216 × 682). Although this
resolution looks different, it is still in HD format. Remember to select this resolution in your game
or other application in order to take advantage of it.

            Note: Some games or applications may not support the new resolu-
            tion.

You may encounter issues when attempting to install the NVIDIA Control Panel from the Windows
Store under Windows 10, such as
 The download process from the Windows Store freezes at the "Starting download ..." stage.
 The NVIDIA Control Panel fails to download after initiating the download from the notification

    popup that appears upon installing the driver.

For assistance with installing the NVIDIA Control Panel from the Microsoft Windows Store, see

Windowed NVIDIA G-SYNC is Disabled for Multi-
monitor System Video Playback

Issue

Beginning with Windows 10 April 2018 Update (RS4), NVIDIA G-SYNC is disabled during active
video playback on multi-monitor systems.

Explanation

If hardware accelerated video is playing on one display and an application is launched on another
display in windowed mode with NVIDIA G-SYNC or adaptive-sync enabled, the video stutters. This
is the result of desktop compositing on displays with differing refresh rates.
To prevent the video stutter in this scenario, the driver disables NVIDIA G-SYNC during active
video playback, but re-enables G-SYNC if the video is paused or closed.

             Note: The issue can also occur when displays are set to different
             refresh rates, even when G-SYNC is not used. To resolve in this case,
             make sure all displays are set to the same refresh rate.

GPU Temperature Reported Incorrectly on Optimus
Systems

Issue

On Optimus systems, temperature-reporting tools such as Speccy or GPU-Z report that the
NVIDIA GPU temperature is zero when no applications are running.

Explanation

On Optimus systems, when the NVIDIA GPU is not being used then it is put into a low- power
state. This causes temperature-reporting tools to return incorrect values.
Waking up the GPU to query the temperature would result in meaningless measurements
because the GPU temperature change as a result.
These tools will report accurate temperatures only when the GPU is awake and running.

Damaged or Missing WMI Service Prevents NVIDIA
Driver Installation

Issue

"Install failed" or "Install Failed, could not find compatible graphics hardware" message may
appear during installation, even if the system has a compatible graphics card. This can occur
when installing the NVIDIA driver or GeForce Experience software.

Cause

This issue could be the result of a corrupt WMI service on your system. The NVIDIA Installer
requires the WMI service to properly install the driver or other NVIDIA software.

Resolution

You must repair the WMI service on your system in order to successfully install NVIDIA drivers. A
future driver release will alert the user during installation that there is a problem with the WMI
service on the system.

Screen Turns Black During Clean Driver Overinstall on
Windows 8.1 Optimus Notebook

Issue

After installing a Release 325 driver earlier than version 326.09 on an Optimus notebook running
Windows 8.1, a subsequent clean overinstall of a later driver results in a black screen. The screen
turns black when the driver uninstalls the older driver.
Typically, you may encounter this when attempting to upgrade the NVIDIA driver after installing
Windows 8.1. While installing Windows 8.1, Windows Update installs NVIDIA driver version 326.01,
then during the clean overinstall the black screen occurs as the older driver is uninstalled.

Workaround - Prevention

To avoid the issue during the initial installation of Windows 8.1, do not reboot the system after
Windows Update installs the NVIDIA driver. Then perform the custom clean overinstall of the
newer driver.

Resolution

This issue does not occur after installing an NVIDIA driver version 326.09 or later for Windows 8.1.
When driver version 326.09 or later is installed, performing a clean overinstall with a newer driver
will not result in a black screen.

Total Available Graphics Memory Reported Incorrectly

Background-TAG Memory

In the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), Total Available Graphics (TAG) memory is reported
as the sum of

    · Dedicated Video Memory (video memory dedicated for graphics use)
    · Dedicated System Memory (system memory dedicated for graphics use), and
    · Shared System Memory (system memory shared between the graphics subsystem and the

        CPU).

The values for each of these components are computed according to WDDM guidelines when the
NVIDIA Display Driver is loaded.

Issue

Some TAG-reporting APIs represent video memory using 32-bits instead of 64-bits, and
consequently do not properly report available graphics memory when the TAG would otherwise
exceed 4 gigabytes (GB). This results in under reporting of available memory and potentially
undesirable behavior of applications that rely on these APIs to report available memory.

Release 450 Driver for Windows, Version 452.06  RN-08399-452.06_v01 | 23
                                                                                                                          Known Product Limitations

The under reporting can be extreme. For example, 6 GB might be reported as 454 MB, and 8 GB
might be reported as 1259 MB.

Driver Action for GeForce-based Graphics Systems

On graphics systems with less than 2.75 GB of advertized physical memory, the NVIDIA display
driver typically limits the Shared System Memory to maintain a TAG memory value of less than 4
GB1.
 This results in reliable reporting of sub-4 GB TAG memory on systems with less than 2.75 GB

    of advertised physical memory.
 On systems with 2.75 GB or more of advertized physical memory, you may see different

    reported TAG memory values between the NVIDIA Control Panel and other reporting APIs.

Increasing 4-way SLI/Multi-GPU Performance

Issue

With some games and applications, you may experience little to no performance gain or even a
performance drop with 4-way SLI or multi-GPU configurations.

Resolution

1 Open the NVIDIA Control Panel, then click Manage 3D Settings from the navigation pane.
2. Click the Global Settings tab, then scroll to the Power management mode feature, click the

    corresponding list arrow and select Prefer maximum performance, then click Apply.

No PhysX Acceleration Using the GPU

If after installing the PhysX System Software you find that there is no PhysX acceleration on
supported applications, repeat the PhysX setup as follows:
1 Reboot the PC.
2. Open the NVIDIA Control Panel and then, under 3D Settings, click Set PhysX configuration

    to open that page.
3. Under Select a PhysX processor, verify that either auto-select or a specific NVIDIA GPU is

    selected.
4. Click Apply.

1. The WDDM guidelines dictate minimum and maximum values for the components, but the display driver
may further constrain the values that are reported (within the allowed minimum and maximum).

NVIDIA PhysX Software Cannot Be Installed/Uninstalled
in Windows Safe Mode

Issue

The NVIDIA PhysX System Software is not included in the NVIDIA driver installation/uninstallation
under safe mode.

Explanation

The NVIDIA PhysX System Software installer is not compatible with Microsoft's policy for Windows
Safe Mode. Consequently, installation or uninstallation of the PhysX System Software under safe
mode would fail. To allow installation or uninstallation of the graphics driver under safe mode, the
NVIDIA PhysX System Software is blocked from the process.

Do Not Use Windows Rollback for Graphics Drivers

To reinstall a previous or older NVIDIA graphics driver, do not use the Windows rollback feature.
This method will not reliably restore all the previous driver files.

Instead, use the Windows Add and Remove programs to remove the current driver, and then
install the older driver using setup.exe.

Uninstalling Drivers Using Device Manager is Not
Supported

Issue

On all supported versions of Microsoft Windows, uninstalling the NVIDIA driver using the Windows
Device Manager may not remove associated files or applications.

Explanation

Microsoft has confirmed that this behavior is by design. If you wish to uninstall the NVIDIA driver,
it is recommended that you do so using Add and Remove programs.
See the Microsoft KB article 2278714.

Changing Primary Display Across SLI GPUs Slower
Than Expected

Issue

On an SLI system, switching the primary (or SLI focus) display when each display in the SLI group
is connected to a different GPU takes longer than expected.

Explanation

On an SLI system with each SLI GPU driving a display, the display connected to the slave GPU is
the primary display (also the SLI focus display). In order to switch the primary display to the one
connected to the other GPU, the master and slave GPU configuration must also switch. In order to
reassign which GPU is the master and which is the slave, the driver must be reloaded. It is the
process of reloading the driver that takes the additional time.

Using HDMI Audio with Displays That Have a High
Native Resolution

To use HDMI audio with some displays that have a native resolution higher than 1920 × 1080, you must
set the display to a lower HD resolution.

Some HDMI displays have a native resolution that exceeds the maximum supported HD mode. For
example, displays with a native resolution of 1920 × 1200 exceed the maximum supported HD
mode of 1920 × 1080.

Applying this native mode results in display overscan which cannot be resized using the NVIDIA
Control Panel since the mode is not an HD mode.

To avoid this situation and provide a better user experience, the driver treats certain TVs- such as
the Viewsonic VX2835wm and the Westinghouse LVM- 37w3-as a DVI monitor when applying the
native mode. Because the driver does not treat the TV as an HDMI in this case, the HDMI audio is
not used.

Using HDMI/DisplayPort Audio in Dualview or Clone
Mode

Two Audio-enabled Ports

In a multi-display configuration where both HDMI/DisplayPort audio ports are enabled, only the
primary display will provide the audio.

One Audio-enabled Port

In a multi-display configuration where only one audio port is enabled, such as when one display is
a DVI display, then the HDMI/DisplayPort display can provide the audio whether is it the primary or
secondary display.

Flat Panel Scaling Controls Not Functional for Some TV
Modes and Displays

The NVIDIA Control Panel flat panel scaling controls on the "Adjust Size & Position" page are not
intended to be used for TV modes, and normally the controls are not available for TV or HDTV
displays.

However, Microsoft requires that certain TV/HDTV modes be available for all digital displays,
including DVI and HDMI, even if they are not HDTV.

While the NVIDIA flat panel scaling controls are available for those displays, they will not be
functional for the TV modes that appear in compliance with the Microsoft requirements. The
affected modes are as follows:
 1920 × 1080i @ 50/59.94/60 Hz
 1280 × 720p @ 50/59.94/60 Hz

GPU Runs at a High Performance Level in Multi-display
Modes

This is a hardware limitation with desktop and older notebook GPUs, and not a software bug.
When multiple displays are connected and active, the GPU will always operate with full clock
speeds in order to efficiently drive multiple displays-even when no 3D programs are running.

             Note: NVIDIA notebook GeForce 5xxM series and later GPUs do not
             have this limitation. For those GPUs the driver can adjust the perfor-
             mance level, depending on demand, even when driving multiple dis-
             plays.

1280 × 1024 @ 60 Hz Not Available on BenQ FP241W
Monitors

Even though the monitor EDID lists 1280 × 1024 @ 60 Hz, the screen turns blank when using an
HDMI connection. This is an issue with the monitor and not the NVIDIA driver.

Because of this issue with the monitor, the NVIDIA driver blocks the problem mode (1280 × 1024 @
60 Hz) and makes it unavailable.

Driver Installation

Minimum Hard Disk Space

The hard disk space requirement is approximately 1.5x the size of the installation download to
accommodate extracted and temporary files.

Before You Begin

nTune

If you have previously installed NVIDIA nTune, NVIDIA recommends that you uninstall nTune
before installing this driver. After the driver install is complete, you can reinstall NVIDIA nTune.

Notebooks

 Check to make sure that your notebook has a supported GPU (see "Supported NVIDIA
    Notebook Products" on page 31).

 It is recommended that you back up your current system configuration.
 If you own a Dell Inspiron 1420, Dell XPS M1330, Dell XPS M1530, or Dell Latitude D630 or

    D630c, it is highly recommended that you first install this Dell software update.

Installation Instructions

           Obtaining NVIDIA Drivers: Microsoft now provides only SHA-2 signed
           drivers. If your Windows 7 system is NOT equipped to detect SHA-2, you
           need to install the SHA-2 update support patches. For details as well as
           access to SHA-2 update support patches, see the Microsoft KBA "2019
           SHA-2 Code Signing Support requirement for Windows and WSUS".

1 Follow the instructions on the NVIDIA.com Web site driver download page to locate the
    appropriate driver to download, based on your hardware and operating system.

2. From the driver download page, click the Download button.
    The Download Confirmation page appears.

3. If you agree to the "License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software", click the Agree &
    Download button to begin the download.
    The File Download dialog appears.

4. Either click Save to save the file and then run it from your PC, or click Run.
    An extraction path dialog appears prompting you to specify where on your PC you want the
    driver files to be installed.

5. Click OK to use the default location, or click the folder icon and specify an alternate location
    to install the driver files.
    The files are extracted and then the NVIDIA Installer is launched automatically.

6. At the License Agreement page of the Installer, click Agree and Continue.
7. Follow the instructions in the NVIDIA Installer to complete the installation.

            Note: The driver presents game screenshots while the driver is
            installing. If you are not connected to the internet during the installa-
            tion, you may see a "Navigation to the webpage was cancelled" message
            instead. The message can be ignored and does not affect the installa-
            tion. The message won't appear if the browser cache is cleared.

            Note: The NVIDIA PhysX System Software will not be included in the
            installation if the same version or a later version is already installed.

            Note: After the driver installation, Windows 7 may default to 16-bpp
            color and disable the Desktop Window Manager (DWM). To work around
            this issue, set the color to 32-bpp and then reboot the PC.

See also the installation/uninstallation considerations explained in "Known Product Limitations"
on page 20.
